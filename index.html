        <div class="container">
            <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Nandha. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
                While I mainly specialize in computing systems, this portfolio contains design work from an educational
                technology class I completed. </p>

            <h3>Redesign of Clozemaster</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>As part of my EdTech class at Georgia Tech, a group and I chose an application to redesign using the
                    lense of language inequalities. Below I will summarize new and improved features developed to help
                    non-english speaking users have a better experience with the app. Clozemaster is a freemium language
                    learning app targeted towards users that have had some experience in
                    the language they are trying to learn. The main feature focuses on letting users fill in blanks on
                    culturally contextualized sentences. </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Pain Points</h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Through user research, our group found certain pain points while using the app.</p>
                <h5 class="feature">Clozemaster currently contains very limited features to assess how well a user is
                    learning their
                    target language.</h5>
                <h5 class="feature">There are no features that promote user retention through gamification.</h5>
                <h5 class="feature">The app only focuses on flashcard style learning. While this is the main point of
                    the app,
                    diversification of learning styles are important for better knowledge retention. </h5>
                <h5 class="feature">Certain parts of the app are confusing, especially to a user whose native language
                    is not Engh5sh
                </h5>
                <h5 class="feature">For an app that boasts incorporation of cultural context, it does not do a good job
                    of doing so.
                </h5>
            </div>
            <h4>Proposed Features</h4>

            <div class="container">
                <p>Studying the pain points, our group proposed 5 new features to improve Clozemaster through the lense
                    of
                    Language Inequalities</p>
                <div class="feature">
                    <H5>Feature 1: Add audio phonetics to flashcards so users can hear words they are selecting both in
                        their native and learning language</H5>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h5>Feature 2: Modify UI text on the application to also include translations from the user's native
                        language.</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h5>Feature 3: Add lessons and videos to help a user understand the cultures and traditions of the
                        language they are learning.</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h5>Feature 4: Allow users learning the same language from the same original language to speed date
                        and
                        discuss prompted topics.</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h5>Feature 5: Incorporate mini-games to make learning more interactive</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h4>
            Testing Phases
        </h4>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                During the development process, we had two low-fi prototypes made with hand-sketches and powerpoint.
                Next,
                we had three iterations of high-fi prototypes on Figma. We asked for feedback and conducted blind tests
                on
                users that fit the target category as well as the professor and TA's from the class. Below are some
                examples of feedback we recieved.
            </p>
            <h5 class="feature">
                Features, while they improve quality of life, are not specifically targeted towards helping language
                minorities.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="feature">
                UI elements are often confusing, and could be simplified or made clear to those who are not strong in
                the English language.
            </h5>
